# hello-world
Learning something new
I'm an IT Neetworking and Desktop Support Guru
I'm teaching myself GitHub. I don't know what I plan to do with it, or where I plan to go from here, but I'll have that figured out by the time I get this down.
My 'coding' experience started with MS-DOS commmand line, but formally consists of Assembly and HTML languages.
That's all for now.
